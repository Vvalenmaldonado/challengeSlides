Welcome to the repository for my practical exercise for Slides. This project is a modern and efficient demonstration of a web application built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I have focused on adhering to the best development and design practices to ensure optimal performance, accessibility, and user experience.

Technologies and Tools
Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
Framer Motion: Integrated to add smooth animations and transitions.
React Use: A collection of useful Hooks for managing various states and effects within React components.
CLSX: Used for dynamically managing element classes, making style conditionality easier to handle.
Features
Optimal Performance: Achieving perfect scores in Lighthouse across all categories (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO) when tested in incognito mode.
Enhanced SEO: Implemented with Next.js best practices, ensuring the application is easily indexable and rankable by search engines.
Modern Development Practices: Code structure and design patterns following current recommendations for React and Next.js applications.

This project was deployed using Vercel.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
